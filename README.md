NoSlowAnimations
================
Don't get slowed down by the Animations on iOS 7 and iOS 8
The official NoSlowAnimation GitHub Repository.



After I updated to iOS 7 I noticed a heavy differnce. No it wasn't the design change :P
The Animations for opening or closing an App were super slow compared to iOS 6. So I decided to write a jailbreak tweak for that. That's where NoSlowAnimations comes in. The Tweak can change the aniamtions speed to whatever you like.
It's combatible with iOS 7 to iOS 8. 
Hopefully you will have fun with it and it brings more life into your iOS device.

Donate
================
In my opinion, everybody should have faster animations speed so I decided to make this tweak for free and open source. If you like it, I would really appreciate it if you make a donation. The money will completley used for equipment and motivation doing more jailbreak stuff, etc. !
