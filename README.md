NoSlowAnimations
================
Don't get slowed down by the animations on iOS 9<br>
The official NoSlowAnimation GitHub Repository.</p>



After I updated to iOS 9 I noticed a heavy difference. No it wasn't the design change :P<br>
The animations for opening or closing an App were super slow compared to iOS 8. So I decided to develop a jailbreak tweak for that. That's where NoSlowAnimations comes in. The Tweak  changes the aniamtions speed to whatever you like.
It's combatible with iOS 9. <br>
Hopefully you will have fun with it and it will bring more life into your iOS devices.

Donate
================
In my opinion, everybody should have faster animations so I decided to make this tweak free and open source. <br>If you like it, I would really appreciate it if you  make a donation. The money will completley used for equipment and motivation doing more jailbreak stuff, etc. ! <br>
