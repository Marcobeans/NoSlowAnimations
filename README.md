NoSlowAnimations
================
Don't get slowed down by the animations on iOS 7, 8 and 9

The official NoSlowAnimation GitHub Repository.

After I updated to iOS 7, I noticed a heavy difference. No, it wasn't the design change :P

The animations for opening or closing an app were super-slow compared to iOS 6.

So I decided to develop a jailbreak tweak for that. That's where NoSlowAnimations comes in. NoSlowAnimations changes the animation speed to whatever you want.

It's compatible with iOS 7 to 9.

Hopefully you will have fun with it and it will bring more life into your iOS devices.

In my opinion, everybody should have faster animations so I decided to make this tweak free and open source.
