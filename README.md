NoSlowAnimations
================
Don't get slowed down by the Animations on iOS 7 and iOS 8</p>
The official NoSlowAnimation GitHub Repository.



After I updated to iOS 7 I noticed a heavy difference. No it wasn't the design change :P</p>
The Animations for opening or closing an App were super slow compared to iOS 6. So I decided to develop a jailbreak tweak for that. That's where NoSlowAnimations comes in. The Tweak  changes the aniamtions speed to whatever you like.
It's combatible with iOS 7 to iOS 8. </p>
Hopefully you will have fun with it and it will bring more life into your iOS device.
